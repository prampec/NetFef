# NetFef
NetFef is three layered network protocol, capable to be adopted on various network solutions.

The basics of the protocol is intended to have small footprint, to be capable to run on low memory smart devices.

The default implementation based on serial communication keeping RS485 (Four Eight Five â€“ FEF) in mind. This is a centralized solution with one master device instrumenting the other devices. But the devices are functioning autonomous.

NetFef implementation is currently available in C++ (Arduino) and Java languages.
